# Store Inventory (Bamazon)
This is a node.js application which interacts with MySQL. It has different user-interface depending on the user's status. It can be one of three types: `Customer`, `Manager`, `Supervisor`.
* A customer can purchase items from the store
* A manager can: 
  * View products
  * View low inventory
  * Add to inventory
  * Add new product 
* A supervisor can:
  * View product sales by department (Still need to implement)
  * Create new department
